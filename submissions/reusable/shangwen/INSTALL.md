**Attention Please:** There is no install required for this dataset since we only provide the patches and execution logs obtained during our experiments, which are generated by executing the external tools that are publicly available.

To facilitate future research, we post the links to open-source repositories of the APR tools we used in our study. Researchers with interests can install the experiment environment through the instructions in these repositories.
