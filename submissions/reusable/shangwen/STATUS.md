[Reusable]

* Reasons:
  * We release part of the execution logs during our large scale experiment and all the generated patches. All these data is well-organized which makes it easy for others to reuse and repurpose.
  * We explain how the data is collected in detail, thus others can make comprehensive comparison when needed.
  * All the data is placed on a publicly accessible GitHub repository as well [https://github.com/APRStudy/APRStudy].
